# Job Application Manager

Job Application Tracker is a Python program aimed at helping students stay organized in their job hunt.

It is not uncommon for a student to apply to hundreds of jobs in a job search. It is also not uncommon for an employer to take several weeks (sometimes months) to respond to a job application. 

As the number of total job applications increase, the more difficult it is for a student to recall the precise details of each application and each communication with an employer.

Job Application Tracker streamlines information management during a job search, acting as a "CRM" (of sorts) for students.
